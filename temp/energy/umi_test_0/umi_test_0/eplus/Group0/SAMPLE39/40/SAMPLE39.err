   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Likely non-planar surfaces
   ************* ..EnergyPlus Surfaces should be planar. If the error indicates a small increment for the
   ************* ..out of planar bounds, then the calculations are likely okay though you should try to fix
   ************* ..the problem. If a greater increment, the calculations will likely be incorrect.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
